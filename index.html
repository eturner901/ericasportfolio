        Greetings! Quick fact about me is that Washington is the sixth state that I've lived in. Five out of six were over the last 10 years of my life. 
        I lived in Senatobia, MS my first two years of college, then moved to Atlanta, GA for my last two (actually 3) years of college. 
        I relocated to Fargo, ND for my first adult job. I then moved to Dallas, TX for my husband's job, and here I am in Seattle (really Bothell) for my job again! 
        I have things that I love and strongly dislike about all of the places I've lived, and they've all played a crucial part in who I am today. 
         <br>
         <br>
        I'm a basketball junkie. I love to have debates about basketball with absolutely anyone, including my manager. Organized basketball was a major part of my life.
        I was on a basketball team from age 8 all the way through collegiate athletics, ending at age 21. This is also a huge part as to why I'm in this bootcamp. 
        I mean who can do three a day practices and major in Computer Science? Surely not I! 
        <br>
        <br>
        I like to cook lasagna and make taco salad. Not at the same time though. Actually, I have not tried that combination but I'll assume it's not a good fit.
